Hi! 
I am heroisaprinciple or Arina. I am a rubyist from Ukraine.

Also, I know JS (Node.js better than React), Python and C/C++. 

In addition, I have a good knowledge in SQL, MongoDB and had experience working with Redis.

Programming is my passion. 
In my free time, I read, watch movies and take photos of landscape views.
